## Python/JAX Coding Conventions

### Coding Style & Naming
- Follow PEP 8: 4-space indentation, 100-char soft line limit, type hints required for public APIs.
- Always place imports at the top of files, except in the rare case that they should be in a conditional for performance or typing reasons.
- Naming: modules/packages `lower_snake_case`; functions/variables `snake_case`; classes `PascalCase`; constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Docstrings: Google style; include shapes/dtypes for JAX arrays when relevant.

### Environment Management
- Use `uv` for all package management. Do not run `pip install` directly.

### Equinox Modules
- Subclass `equinox.Module` for dataclasses-that-are-PyTrees; do not add `@dataclass` again. `Module` subclasses are already dataclasses and PyTree nodes.
- Treat `Module` instances as immutable. Use `equinox.tree_at` (or `eqx.tree_at`) for out-of-place updates; avoid direct attribute assignment.
- Use `eqx.field` for defaults/converters. Only implement custom flattening when necessary; otherwise rely on `Module`'s default behavior.

### JAX Tree API
- Import once as `import jax.tree as jt` and use the `jt.*` namespace throughout (e.g., `jt.map`, `jt.leaves`, `jt.structure`, `jt.flatten`, `jt.unflatten`).
- Do not use deprecated `jax.tree_*` helpers (e.g., `jax.tree_map`, `jax.tree_leaves`). Prefer `jax.tree.*` consistently.

### jax_cookbook Helpers
- `import jax_cookbook.tree as jtree` for PyTree utilities not in core JAX (e.g., `jtree.unzip`, `jtree.get_ensemble`). Use `jtree.*` for these helpers.
- `from jax_cookbook import is_type, is_module, is_none` for convenient shorthands. For example, `jt.map(..., is_leaf=is_type(tuple))`, `jt.map(..., is_leaf=is_module)` (for `equinox.Module` instances).

### Feedbax Integration
- rlrmp depends on feedbax. When fixing bugs or adding features that require changes to feedbax, make those changes directly in the feedbax repo (on the appropriate feature branch) rather than working around them in rlrmp. Maintain near-integration with feedbax at all times — do not deviate from feedbax's APIs or bypass its abstractions.
- The feedbax repo is at `~/Main/10 Projects/10 PhD/20 Feedbax/feedbax/`. Use worktrees for feature work, following the same conventions as this repo.

## Feedbax Studio
Feedbax Studio (web app) runs from the Feedbax repo. See Feedbax CLAUDE.md for server startup instructions.

## Issue Coordination

### Project Analyses Coordination Umbrella

Issue `4d38c15` is the **project analyses coordination umbrella** — central place for cross-cutting decisions about analyses. **Always check it when:**

- **Discovering a new analysis worth doing.** File a normal issue for the analysis itself, AND comment on the umbrella with: new issue ID, initial tier guess (essential / desirable / auxiliary), one-line rationale.
- **Shifting tier priority** of an existing analysis. Comment on the umbrella, NOT on the individual analysis issue. Include: issue ID(s), old tier → new tier, reason.
- **Cross-cutting findings** affecting multiple analyses (e.g. "X turned out subsumed by Y", "Z became less informative after we changed training method").

Individual analysis issues focus on the analysis itself; how analyses fit into the bigger scheme is dealt with on the umbrella.

**Do NOT reference the umbrella in commit `Bug:` trailers** — that auto-closes the umbrella on merge. Reference only the relevant child issues.
