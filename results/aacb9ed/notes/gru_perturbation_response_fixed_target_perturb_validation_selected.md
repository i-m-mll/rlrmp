# GRU perturbation-response bank

Issue: `aacb9ed`. Source experiment: `aacb9ed`.

The bank is controller-independent: it perturbs external task, command-port, process, sensory, observation, or target interfaces and does not mutate GRU internals.

v2 splits the former plant_force rows into command_input_pulse (post-controller command-port perturbations) and process_epsilon_pulse (mechanics.epsilon / B_w process perturbations). Process-epsilon rows span the canonical current physical block [px, py, vx, vy, fx, fy, eps_x_int, eps_y_int].

## Residuals

- ExtLQG comparator: available_for_initial_state_and_process_epsilon - Deterministic extLQG response rows are evaluated for perturbations with clean analytical interfaces: initial_state and process_epsilon. Command-input, sensory-feedback, and delayed-observation GRU rows are evaluated through temporary external graph adapters, but do not yet have matching analytical extLQG channel adapters; target-stream is deferred for current fixed-target checkpoints.
- Full-Q/R/Q_f perturbation cost: available - Costs are rescored post hoc from states.mechanics.vector and states.net.output using the canonical C&S Q_t/R_t/Q_f schedule. They are audit-only perturbation diagnostics and are not used for checkpoint selection.
